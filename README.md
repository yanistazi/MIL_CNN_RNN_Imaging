# MIL_CNN_RNN_MSK_MIND

Multitple Instance Learning with CNN embedding and RNN final classification by information integration using tile embedding. The model is fully customizable and we allow multiple arguments to be passed in order to perform gridsearch . The user of the model can simply clone the repo and use one of the 4 main functions to train , test , plot metrics , perform gridsearch across any CNN , RNN (bidirectional or not) , optimizer and other parameters. See Tutorial notebook for a detailed explanation

The initial framework was inspired by MIL 2019 paper. The drive containing some of the data and more information is here :
